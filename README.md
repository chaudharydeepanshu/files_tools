## 🤔Why I spent time recreating this app?

I've been making apps for a while now, and over that time, I've learned a lot. After learning about application development and flutter, this was my first project. I was very pleased with what I produced, although it was riddled with mistakes and flaws because I didn't know much at the time. However, I liked the concept behind it, so later, when I had some free time, I recreated it while taking all of the flaws from the old version into account, and it came out far better than the old one. And I have to admit that I learnt a lot more new knowledge during this process.

Please be aware of the following things as well:-
- This project utilises itext7 for various operations involving PDFs.
- Since itext7 AGPL V3 License is used in this project, Files Tools are also licenced under this licence.
